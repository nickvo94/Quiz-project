Write a quiz program. Questions contain at least following information.
 Question

 Correct answer (1,2,3, 4)

The program must have (at least) following commands:
1. Initialize (clear all questions)
2. Save questions to disk
3. Read questions from disk
4. Add a new question. Program asks user to enter new question and then asks user to enter answer
alternatives. Then program prints question and alternatives and asks user to enter the correct
answer which is saved.
5. Take the quiz. Program asks user 5 random questions (no duplicates allowed). After each question
program tells if answer was correct or not but does not display the correct answer. After the quiz
the program prints the final score (for example: Your score is 3 out of 5)
6. Print a report which lists all questions but does not display the answers

Program displays the question to user as follows:

What is the first day of week in the Jewish calendar?
1) Sunday
2) Monday
3) Friday
Enter your answer:

The alternatives must be displayed in random order when user takes the quiz and program picks two incorrect alternatives out of the three to display
